A repository of used to store my Coursera lab exercises.
My name is Kyle McGrath. I graduated last year (when the pandemic was beginning) with a master's degree in Positive Developmental Psychology and Evaluation from Claremont Graduate University. I've been taking online classes to learn data analysis since then to improve my job search prospects.
